Practice promises and async/await

todo:

<!--
    - You should be able to search for a specific location
    - toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius
    - You should change the look of the page based on the data
        -  maybe by changing the color of the background or by adding images that describe the weather. (You could even use the Giphy API to find appropriate weather-related gifs and display them).
    - use promises or async/await
    - Write the functions that process the JSON data
        -  return an object with only the data you require for your app.
    - Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info
    - Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
